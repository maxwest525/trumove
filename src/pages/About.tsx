            <div className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
              <p>
                TruMove was created by people who have seen both sides of the moving industry – the customers who feel stressed and in the dark, and the operations teams trying to juggle trucks, crews, and unpredictable demand.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of another broker making calls in the background, TruMove works more like a flight search engine. Our AI connects to real carrier data, capacity, and route networks so you can compare options in one place, then lock in a transparent price in minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every move that runs through TruMove feeds back into the system. That means better price predictions, smarter carrier matching, and fewer surprises for the next customer. The platform gets smarter with every truck that rolls.
              </p>
              <p className="font-semibold text-foreground">
                Our goal is simple: make moving as easy and transparent as booking a flight.

              <p>
                When you enter your details, TruMove is doing a lot behind the scenes: checking verified movers on your lanes, cross checking licensing and reviews, and stress testing the quote against what actually happened on similar moves in the past.
              </p>
              <p>
                The result is a price that is designed to hold up in the real world, not just look good on a website.
