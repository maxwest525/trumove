# Spread Out Trust Strip Items Even More

## Goal

Further increase the spacing between trust strip items for an even more open, spacious layout.

---

## Implementation

### File: `src/index.css`

#### Change: Increase gap between items (line 28657)

```css
/* Before */
gap: 32px;

/* After */
gap: 48px;
```

---

## Summary of Changes

| File | Line | Change |
|------|------|--------|
| `src/index.css` | 28657 | Increase gap from `32px` to `48px` |

---

## Expected Result

- Trust strip items will have 50% more spacing between them (48px instead of 32px)
- The strip will feel even more open and breathable
- Items will remain centered and horizontally scrollable on smaller screens
